# genlayout
This is the layout analyzer and generator that was used to create [Semimak](https://semilin.github.io/semimak). It is centered around the novel finger-speed metric. This program was made for myself, and because of that **it's not very easy to use,** especially if you don't have any programming experience. I am currently working on a powerful, configurable, and user-friendly web-based and desktop analyzer+generator. 

## Usage
`./genkey command argument`
### Commands
#### [load]
Reads `text.txt` in the same directory and outputs its bigram, trigram, and skipgram data into `data.json`. This data is used for every other command.

Outputs a sorted list of all the layouts with their scores.
#### [a]nalyze layout
Outputs detailed analysis of a given layout.
#### [g]enerate
Attempts to find the optimal layout according to the scoring algorithm.
#### [sfbs] layout (x)
Lists the sfb frequency and most frequent sfbs. Optionally, x can be provided to set how many are listed.
#### [dsfbs] layout (x)
Lists the dsfb frequency and most frequent dsfbs. Optionally, x can be provided to set how many are listed.
#### [speed] layout (x)
Lists each finger and its unweighted speed for the layout. Optionally, x can be provided to set how many are listed.
### [bigrams] layout (x)
Lists the worst bigrams for the layout. Optionally, x can be provided to set how many are listed.
